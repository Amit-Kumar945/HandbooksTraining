This is the third step in learning traefik, here we will use traefik configuration file to manage our setup

Things to notice
- Traefik dashboard is running on 8090 port
- We have one more tab(file) in providers section
- We have a frontend fe-frontend, mapped to a backend
- We have a backend load balancer sitting on top of 2 URL's
- Can we have docker containers as a reference instead of url in backend
